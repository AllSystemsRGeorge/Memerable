# Memerable
An API app dedicated to video games and memes!

Well, hello fellow gamer!

Do you find yourself constantly losing hours in a game, but sometimes you need a little break to distract yourself? Or perhaps some griefer in Call of Duty got you with a knife despite filling him with lead? Regardless, sometimes we need a little distraction, or destresser from our time playing video games to give us a moment of clarity!

Introducing, Memerable! 

A fun, gamer-friendly app with the potential of not only putting a smile on your face, but making sure your controller or mouse doesn't become embedded in your wall! Choose from a content of the hottest games on the market, then go over to the next page and choose something that will make you smile, or lower the blood cholestrol in your system!
